# jumblebot

ROT13-like inline telegram bot. Type `@jumblebot this is some text` and click on the result `9:D :D D@>6 E6IE` to send it. Anyone can now copy that result and type `@jumblebot 9:D :D D@>6 E6IE` to see the original text again. Great for sending obfuscated and easily decipherable messages to avoid, for example, spoilers.
